This is my first attempt to make simple weather app using html, css and js DOM.
I have used weather api to fetch weather information.
I have used photo spalash to show weather condition .however ,it's not working and its still in WIP.
At the moment,lighthouse accessibility score is 93 % (which i will fix soon to make it 100%) and performance is 100%.
