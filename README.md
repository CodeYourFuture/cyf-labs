# CYF Labs

This is a static semantic HTML page with Sass and SVG assets. I made it for CYF Labs, which is a page we need to have online for the company our charity owns.

- `index.html`: This file is the main HTML file for the static page.
- `assets/styles/main.scss`: This file is the main SCSS file for the page. It imports the other sass files, not listed.
- `scripts/data-component.js` This file is a vanilla web component to render and animate data.
- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.
